this mix makes the most delicious pancakes! my gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs! i have also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it! so good!
lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate, smooth, slightly tingly and delicious drink
i have two cats, one who eats wet food as a last resort (mostly she licks up the gravy), and one who has food allergies (grains) and is incredibly picky (won't eat any grain free cat treats i've found so far--greenies, the tasty junk food ones, wellness cat jerky bits, shaved salmon, etc-- doesn't like catnip, and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than $1
it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy, sauce, mixed vegetables or anything you like
my role is to greet them with a tasty treat - usually a gravy bone, which they love
when making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of bisto granules, stir quickly) but for really good gravy i prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go
yes, it looks and smells tasty--flakey chunks in gravy
the meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines
these varieties have lots of gravy, while most of the other flavors are a bit less juicy
my cats love this cat food and it's loaded with juicy gravy, which my male cat needs to keep from getting urinary tract infection
heated for a minute in the microwave, it melts back into a delicious brown gravy
inside the can you will find nicely sized tender chunks of beef with tasty gravy
the gravy is very tasty without being overly salty
however, the chicken wings fall apart easily and are very soft the bones literally turn to mush
it makes a nice, tasty gravy over potatoes, hot sandwiches, etc
with this riceselect royal blend, the rice stands on its own -- nutty, chewy -- a real treat
very convenient - pour one can in the bottom of the pot, put your meat in, pour a second can over all - and you have a very tasty meal with the addition of a veggie and a carb (rice, potato - or even biscuits) - spoon the gravy over the carb cooked separately - or cook the veggies and carbs in the same pot - good both ways
(and i know, because i have tried them all!)  thankfully, i found this food before he starved to death!!!  he really likes it -- he will even lick the bottom of his bowl clean (and he never did that before!)  the food is not pate' style -- it is actually soft, moist little "rectangle" shapes of food in a light sauce/gravy
when i think of chicken pot pie i drool over the chicken and vegetables and pie crust along with the delicious gravy
in addition to making quick and delicious white gravy, i use it to thicken the broth in my chicken and dumplings
just mix it with water in the pan and whisk while it comes to the boil and simmer for only one minute and i had tasty vegan gravy!  it was perfect on my edward & sons organic, vegan, gluten free instant mashed potatoes!  what could be easier or better?they also have a good looking recipe on the back of the packet for a lentil loaf that i plan on trying
very tasty gravy
after eliminating gluten from her diet, she is back to a normal weight (117 for her) it's a challenge to find tasty foods for her so i was very excited to find this gravy and both parents love it!
this gravy is delicious!!!!!!!!!!!  it comes out so thick and flavorful i can hardly believe it's from a mix
) follow the directions on the packet and you will have smooth and tasty gravy every time
this is one tasty gravy
this is marvellous flavouring for soups and gravy
the master's touch did not look as appetizing, and i am still not sure how to describe it - like a brown whipped topping? upon adding boiling water to it, however, it turned into a wonderful, sumptuous, rich, delicious beef gravy
pros:+really tasty, especially if you have a little gravy mix on hand to thicken it
bottom line: this is a fantastic product!  it is delicious, convenient, versatile, and thoroughly enjoyable
it was as delicious as i remembered except that the gravy was very salty
i am going to try it in a pot pie without the gravy as the meat is tender and tasty
maybe i can doctor it up some way--rinse that gravy off and put it spicy mexican casseroles or tacos
in terms of flavor, the gravy was delicious and has some spice to it
while the gravy portion is absolutely delicious, the paneer is sub-par at best
it has a very heavy "onion" flavor to it rather than smokey tomato flavor, which is probably why they call this a "spicy onion gravy"
despite all these oddities, the gravy still is outstanding! almost addictive i'd say! for the price you do get a delicious meal for 2 with each package that takes under 2 minutes to make
i still would recommend a purchase, and i would personally buy this myself it really is that good! just understand that instead of an smokey tomato/onion gravy, you actually end up with a spicy onion gravy
this mtr meal is delicious! i made it and dumped it over a bowl of white rice
the meat is pretty dry and slightly chewy (which is strange for a meat that just falls apart under your fork) but there's so much gravy that you can almost pretend not to notice
salty not over the top spicy but a fantastic compliment to hearty stews, roasts and gravys
the gravy it makes is thin, but so tasty on rice or mashed potatoes, and the roast is sooooo tender
humans would not want to eat only dry cereal or bread every day for every meal, and mewers need tasty morsels, as well
i've been a fan of hot & spicy maruchan ramen for a long time
i've been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid, and i've never found a better flavor than hot & spicy chicken!  it isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!
i love spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! not sure if that is healthy or not
nong shim's spicy chicken noodle bowl offers up a quick, ramen-style noodle dish that comes in a one-serving bowl
like cup-a-noodle and other ramen-type meals, this is basically a fast, reasonably tasty meal for people who are working at the office or just want something really quick at home
these 'ramen-like' noodles will be a tasty addition to anyone's lunch repertoire - providing of course you have a microwave handy at the office\shop
these noodles are more like standard ramen, and have a chewyconsistency
annie chun's vietnamese pho soup is delicious and convenient! since the noodles are fresh,they're a great deal less salty than ramen
top ramen variety pack 48ct (24-3oz beef-24-3oz chicken) is cheap and should be also delicious
while ramen has a soft spot in my heart for getting me through college, thai kitchen noodles are my favorite
so the main difference is this ramen is mild and not spicy like the nong shim counterpart
the most luscious, soft, creamy licorice caramels you could possibly imagine
highly recommend trying some if you like spicy stuff and ramen noodles
these chow mein noodles are absolutely delicious!  they are so much better than typical ramen noodles
drain the noodles from the water, toss them dry with the flavoring packets and some vegetables thrown in, and you'll be set for a delicious meal
you just add a little water, enough that it evaporates the noodles, and that the noodles have their soft & you could even overcook them about 2% so they have a little crisp and soft to them
it was a bit chewy (rice noodles don't firm up like wheat does) but all in all i enjoyed it
it's quick, easy, tasty, and if you put it together with a package of ramen noodles you have a meal in a snap! i work a lot of hours and i greatly value resources that put a meal in front of me with a minimum of hassle and adequate value
what i would do is this: boil the water till hot, add my protein (be it egg, shrimp, fish, etc), then add the freeze-dried vegetables, then add a small amount of the seasoning packet (or usually none at all), keep boiling till soft/cooked
i had a real craving for ramen a few days ago, and considering that the spicy picante from nong shim was pretty good, i decided to give this a try when i saw it at my hyvee
one of the best ramen i've tried, spicy and it comes with a seaweed packet unlike many of the ramen you find in grocery stores
this chili flavor makes a great, spicy ramen with flavor and a little kick
you can enjoy it as a simple ramen soup or add meat and vegetables for a more nutritious and tasty meal
i am not a big lover on spicy foods but boy, these are amazing :djust enough hotness to make my face a little hot but that doesn't stop me from digging into a bowl of these yummy ramen noodles!flavor is perfect!but they are spicy enough that you do need a drink next to your bowl, loltry these! soooo good!
traditionally served with rice, the sauce is also delicious with fried noodles, fried rice, in ramen and can be effortlessly be converted into a vegetarian dish, substituting mushrooms (shitake), bell peppers and onions for ground meat
if you like spicy ramen
i highly recommend to any who enjoys ramen and spicy foods
this is like ramen noodle soup but with a spicy kick
i love spicy food and where i live you can not find spicy ramen
if you like spicy ramen noodles, these are the choice for you!  these are just like the ones my husband used to eat in korea as a kid, so naturally we love them
the quality of the noodles was fantastic (a far cry from any of the brands you can buy at the supermarket) but that broth! spicy didn't even begin to describe it
but anyway this stuff is awesome and it is not for any one who hates spicyness because this stuff is hot! but its packed with soo much flavor,it makes those 15 cent ramen noodles taste like noodles in salt water
very spicy packaged ramen
10 ramen from walmart, these are authentic spicy noodles
it was great deal because i paid less money than offline stores and it was more delicious than any other ramens
this is the most delicious ramen
highly recommended for anyone that likes spicy foods and wants some better quality ramen
it is definitely more spicy than other types of ramen out there but it is so good and you can always add less seasoning if you don't want to have it as spicy
as an individual whom doesn't often eat spicy foods, the spiciness of the seasoning in the ramen is very near upper tolerance level and nothing goes better with it than a cold beer
its a spicy korean ramen comparable to some of its thai counterparts but has to be one of the tastiest ramen noodles i've ever had
good spicy ramen,and when purchased through amazon, pretty cheap
this ramen is salty (and moderately spicy), so you can add extra cooking water and dump it out after serving, or half the seasoning packet
this is a very spicy ramen, and will really make your lips tingle and tongue burn
if you can handle it spicy, this is the best ramen
i regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and i put extra hot sauce in spicy chili
if you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup
the ramen is definitely much more delicious than the famous nissan cup noodle
the taste is phenomenal, nice and spicy (especially if you add the whole packet) with firm noodles that are more chewy that "normal" ramen
i just got this in the mail, ripped it open and threw one in some water:- spicy as hellllllll
in my opinion, everybody here complaining about the whole spice packet being too much must have grown up on hotdogs and hamburgers, or equally not-spicy foods
and i was not disappointed! now, i love noodles of all kind, even the cheap ramen, but these noodles are fantastic! definitely a more hearty texture to the noodles and the spice has got some serious kick! for those who don't like spicy, i would recommend starting with maybe 1/2 of the pack of seasoning & working your way up, but for me, the whole packet is perfect! i've been adding fresh veggies, an egg or two & some shrimp to these noodles & it makes enough for two people easily! i'm sold & will definitely continue to buy these noodles! worth the extra $$ :)
i like the nong shim shin ramen better than the much-less-expensive grocery store ramen  because nong shim is hot-spicy instead of just salty
i've always like spicy food & after living in korea for a couple of years, i was delighted to find this ramyun which is head & shoulders above any other 'ramen' that i've found in a grocery store
add water and you've got yourself spicy corn water
my cat's fur has never been softer, his temperament so easy going, and energy-level so high! highly recommend
i'm in college and decided to "splurge" on some decent ramen, this turned out to be delicious, but at 4 bucks a pop, i minus well buy a footlong at subways
instant ramen is a handy thing to have in the cupboard for a fast and tasty lunch or dinner
use leftover meat, meat of any kind - stir fried or grilled, seafood, soft boiled egg, vegetables of your choice and you would have a perfect bowl of japanese ramen - almost
quick and tasty, and well worth the small premium over other ramens
the broth is tasty but interesting and not too chemical-tasting (i usually use about twice to three times the amount of water called for and it's still fine, given my additions)
after being somewhat disappointed with the "spring vegetable" version of this soup line from annie chun's, i was expecting more of the same with this flavor - but boy, was i pleasantly surprised! the soup base is a delicious and savory broth which is not spicy, and the noodles are not fried unlike traditional ramen noodles
it's not to spicy and the seaweed does not dominate like it does in the nong shim seafood ramen
there is an unhelpful (but critical) suggestion to soak the noodles in water for one minute (to soften them up), followed by two recipes
these heat up when used as noodles quite quickly--within about two minutes in boiling water, although they can stay in longer for softer noodles
these noodles are as easy to cook as ramen noodles, but so much more tasty
or just soften in a bowl of water to be cooked with other things in a frying pan, as per the directions
they are a proper-sized meal, very tasty (and spicy) and just need hot water
this is the best instant ramen (or ramyun, as this is spicy korean style ramen with a beef broth) i have had
these spicy bowls come packed with the same contents of the shin ramen bags with the convenient instant bowls
these noodles have excellent flavour at a great price
the noddle's in this yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what i am use to in the ramen packets that i normally eat but are very tasty
i wasnt expecting how tasty this ramen was going to be
udon and ramen are ok, but these are fabulous, organic and delicious
it is pretty good, sour and spicy and actually pretty filling for a ramen type meal
i craved ramen during my pregnancy and this is a tasty and healthy alternative to top ramen
pros:- famous nong shim noodles taste great (we always have a box in the house)- you can turn it into a full meal with leftovers- plenty spicy- not the thin ramen but korean style thicker ones
this is my favorite spicy ramen
i lived in korea for a year, and i've tried all the different options available here for spicy ramen
if you eat instant ramen and like spicy food, this is for you
for instant ramen lovers who like spicy food, i give this five stars
this is real spicy, so spicy that i had to drain all the water, it still a bit spicy without the liquid
if you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  another idea: combine sweet chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken
but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water
very fresh and tasty soft buns that go well with my omaha steak burger patties
it is crunchy and tasty, but not full of pizzazz - it is a bit bland, but sticks around in the same nostalgic way that twinkies, hamburger helper, ketchup, and jell-o do
with regular bread microwaving makes them rubbery but with these it softens them just right
the bread is a little chewy, which we love, but soft enough for a child to enjoy
i've tried many different gluten and dairy free breads and this is the first one that feels like bread and tastes great too!  it is soft enough to wrap around a hotdog if you choose, even days after baking
these seasonings (other flavors: sicilian & rosa maria) there is also a parmasan blend, but the first 3 are my personal favorites, are absolutely delicious!!! they are also very versatile, you can have them with olive oil for bread dipping or better yet, use them to cook chicken, ground turkey burgers, fish, just about anything you can think of
(note: avoid similar products madewith vegetable oil)following the traditional recipe, this makes a delicious dressing for anygrilled meat including burgers and sausages
now we live in las vegas and the distance makes it hard for us to find the sauce locally, which sucks because i used it for everything! baking chicken breasts in it, on turkey sandwiches, in burgers, on meatloaf, i even add it to the velvita  zesty bbq dinner to get more of that yummy bbq flavour!
what i have done is 1)mix it half and half with ketchup for a spicy burger topping, 2)added a splash to scrambled eggs (best scrambled eggs ever) and 3)added a little to some pulled pork barbeque along with a splash of vinegar and a tiny squeeze of honey
i use it on ground meats (turkey, chicken and beef) to make seriously delicious burgers! i also use this to season chicken (whether baking, grilling, deep frying or pan-frying)
i don't know what to call this recipe, but it is tasty! and soooo easy!then-i can't resist mentioning this silly thing - the empty bowl the rice comes in is a favorite toy of my two minischnauzers
i've used it on steaks, spare ribs, pork chops, hamburger -- you name it, if it's meat, i've used this delicious rub on it!to give you an idea of my tastes, i've used the following three varieties of grill mates: molasses bacon (a close second to this), barbecue, and applewood (which, imo, was way too spicy
sriracha spicy buffalo wings6 chicken wingsoil for frying3 tablespoons frank's red hot sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter, softenedbaby mache or other lettuce to garnishfry the chicken wings until crispy
first off, this is not glorified mustard, it is spicy chipotle sauce, someone i think didnt like the price so they had to cry about something
for example, i've tried a number of "burger substitutes"; forget them!  on the other hand, there are some fantastic "vegetable patties" that fit comfortably on a hamburger bun and provide a healthy, lower calorie alternative to the juicy, fatty hamburger that i remember so fondly
the secret to getting the best taste is to mix it with cold water, and then wait about 10 minutes to let the flavour develop
it was really a perfect complement: spicy, but not with enough of a kick to dominate the meal or make my eyes burn and mouth water, and with that smoky chipotle flavor, rich and full-bodied
most mexican food is very spicy and often has a little kick, i have seen mexicans that use tapatio hot sauce on hamburgers, rice and soups and tapatio packs a kick
while the bottle is a bit on the small side for the pricepoint, the product more than makes up for it by packing a really tasty punch
if you like spicy sauces and you're looking to add a little kick to your burgers and tacos without going too far overboard, give this chipotle sauce a try
really did make a good tasty sauce!  also put on hamburgers after they were cooked
this would make a tasty dipper for chicken, on burgers, fried mushrooms, you name it! i sent it on a wrap sandwich for my husband's lunch as well
it was a bit chewy (rice noodles don't firm up like wheat does) but all in all i enjoyed it
i love it, this trio is delicious, i am buying to give to my friends, because i liked a lot to eat in my hamburgers, salads,beefs,and so on
while it was tasty (like a cheese burger) it was very, very salty
i only wish it came with more macaroni; there's an ample amount of sauce, and more pasta would help it to stretch a little farther, especially when you're trying to feed a hungry family! still, this is a great, tasty product that i could see myself using again and again
i enjoyed this kraft velveeta cheeseburger meal-in-a-box kit: simply cook up one pound of ground beef, drain, add the contents of the packets along with water, and you'll have a delicious dinner in about 15-20 minutes!  the taste here is quite nice: it's different than the 'other' brand (come on, you know, hamburger helper, which is a very similar product), but it's a quick and easy dinner, and quite good
totally recommend this if you love velveeta or the similar meal by hamburger helper- the velveeta skillet meal is much more delicious
in addition to the tradition soft cheese sauce like the velveeta shells boxes come with, there's a seasoning packet to add to the meat, pasta, and water
tasty, filling and easy! i would recommend kraft velveeta ultimate cheesburger skillets dinner to any body that wants to have on hand a fast tasty meal
i've always had a soft-spot for pasta and cheese because when i was raising my six children it was an easy, economical solution for a quick meal that they all liked
the other reason is that when i saw the burger bits on the package it reminded me of good ol' juicy cheeseburgers that i loved in my younger days
yummy! anyway, this dish blends together in a taste reminiscent of a cheeseburger and is very tasty
i thought this kraft velveeta ultimate cheeseburger skillets dinner was very tasty
one note though: cooking for the recommended amount of time makes the pasta really soft
i've eaten tasty mac and cheese, and i've even eaten decent hamburger helper, like <a href="http://www
you brown one pound of beef (i weighed it to be sure i was following directions) and then drain it (pouring out the tasty juices, i won't do that again), then add the misnamed seasoning packet and the pasta, along with two cups of water
kraft velveeta ultimate cheesburger skillets dinnereasy, quick, delicious, one pan to clean up
kraft velveeta ultimate cheesburger skillets dinner is a lot of fun to prepare, and the end product is so delicious -- everyone wants seconds
a delicious cheesy veggie-mac meal, plenty of superb velveeta cheese taste, crunch from the water chestnuts, and chew factor from the mushrooms
it is tasty but a bit salty, and there is not much pasta
the new kraft velveeta chicken and broccoli skillets dinner kit is delicious! a one skillet meal that uses creamy velveeta instead of powdered "cheese flavoring"? i found this to be far superior to the hamburger helper flavor
it islight, and everything i've made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious
needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange
pop 2 crisp thins w/ toppings in microwave, and  you've got your delicious nachos, (or pizza)
(i still appreciate the novelty!)either way, it is aggressively priced, nice and hot, and unlike the other two sauces i've mentioned, has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being 'spicy oil'
and this all means not only are they delicious, but also that you won't go looking for gallons of water, (or soda, or whatever), after you eat a few
gluten free and healthy-totally delicious!the cinnamon sticks are my favorite and the pizza flavored puffs for the savory treat
another thing i love is that it isn't just a spicy red watery liquid as most other sauces
i would always go back to my "polpo" which i make with a base of muir glen diced tomatoes - tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking
we still do pizza every so often, but fast food has lost its allure!  i even went so far as to dab on some baconnaise on a stalk of (ugh) broccoli yesterday & it was eat-able for once!  i can assure you i am not a veggie eater at all!  thanks to this tasty product, i now have hope that i can break my addiction to fast food
these inch and a quarter squares have been generously sprinkled with a zippy, zingy italian-style flavoring that will remind your taste buds of a freshly baked pizza, or a delicious spaghetti dinner
com/gp/product/b002hnzrkq">tabasco brand chipotle pepper sauce - gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that i make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green
when we used to get them on pizza that often was true as whole anchovies were strewn over the pizze(we go way back) it's amazing how everyone loves my pizza sauce and how tasty and full bodied it is, not bland
i personally use it as a pizza crust because it is much healthier than the ones you can buy at the store! but i also make it thicker and cube it up for a delicious protein in my salad
the directions say add 1/3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough
breadsticks are delicious, the pizza crust is awesome
this pizza kit is healthy, tasty, quick, and easy
i love this mix!  i made these as a bread item for our dinner and my husband and daughter, who normally don't like my gluten-free foods, loved them too!  they have a good chewy texture to them
along came pamela and his life changed forever; in fact, he's in  love and it's fine by me, lol! pamela's bread mix makes the best gf pizza crust, ever! it's light, crispy, chewy, crusty, with a delicious fragrance that doesn't scream gf
this is the softest bread i have found
not too thick and a bit chewy just like "real" pizza crust
this makes unusually good bread that is bendable and chewy and a hint of sweetness probaby from the sorghum grain they use
the bread has a nice, soft texture
the flavor reminds me of a soft whole wheat bread, and is slightly sweet
i have made beautiful baked goods with this (all by hand, no stand mixer) including cinnamon buns, yummy chewy pizza crust, pie crust, french bread, pretzels, and the best gluten free bagels i have ever had
i am writing this just after finishing off the last two slices of a delicious, crispy and flavorful gluten-free pizza! this one is a winner
this mix allows me to make delicious bread, rolls, & pizza crust so i don't feel deprived
i made homemade pizza last weekend using this flour and it made the best crust ever, chewy inside, crispy outside and no bleachy aftertaste
once upon a time, chebe made the best pizza crust ever - great texture, thin and chewy, very tasty, even rolled out easily without sticking to pan or rolling pin
it's lost the chewy texture and the great taste and is now just another over-priced gf mix - one package makes one medium-sized pizza
the bread itself is a bit different at first, crunchy/firm on the outside, but soft and somewhat gooey (but not nasty at all) on the inside
amazing gluten free crust!  i had made this for a friend who also has celiac disease, making him the main pizza and me a little mini one, (just big enough for one pepperoni) to try just in case it tasted like so many gluten free mixes-awful-but this tastes like 'real' pizza-if i didn't have self control, poor guy would never have had a pizza to eat!!!  it was delicious, and had a delightful rise and acted like normal wheat dough-i could roll it out and not get sticky
it's not the same as regular pizza crust, but when you havent had pizza in a long time, it tastes delicious
i also add rice based cheese instead of regular cheese, since we cant eat dairy, which makes the crust a little more chewy
i've made the pizza and calzone with this mix and the crust was nice and crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside
using this chebe mix for pizza crusts are finally made tasty! easy to make as well and if you have a look at [
the grill seems to cook it better on the pizza stone and gives it a nice crust, whereas it's still a little chewy in the oven
this stuff is quite tasty, and gets the job done; but no one would ever mistake this pizza crust
the edges were crispy and the main pizza was a little softer but definitely done, and most enjoyable
it took very little time and effort to produce a beautiful and delicious pizza
i made a variety of flavors out of the rest in 4oz wide mouth ball jars---one with bay leave and heated pickle juice; whole peppercorns and hot peppers; mixed with sundried tomatoes packed in grapeseed oil and capers; slice some to go on pizzas, salads, popcorn and made a great spicy dip with garlic and red onions
i ordered this box back in october of last year and i am still eating this stuff, despite putting it on anything mexican-ish and even stuff like pizza rolls (it's delicious)
veri peri mild is delicious for those of us that love an extra kick in our sauce with great flavor too, and not so spicy!  the sauce is so versatile!  try using it on pizza, in salad dressing, or as a marinade for meats and veggies!
i could see it being an excellent addition to a spicy pasta sauce, or pizza sauce
i also made a delicious stove-top tuna casserole-type meal by combining about a cup of this uncooked pasta, then cooking it, a can of tuna drained, some cooked broccoli and diced baby carrots, garlic to taste, and then heated it all together with half a jar of alfredo sauce
i've traveled to italy on several lengthy occasions and often remarked, "you just can't get bad food in italy!"i have used this blend in a white clam sauce mixed with pasta shells and used it in the best spaghetti sauce i've ever  made! i even ran the grinder over a take-out pizza from our local pizza place with very tasty results! the pizza came alive with flavor!pick a couple other of the d & a selections (provence and four seasons pepper corns are recomended!) and get free shipping
great stuff for pizza and any other food that you might sprinkle something spicy on
i don't drink soft drinks, mostly because i don't like them and actually prefer water
i use these to make pizza, pasta sauce, ratatouille, chili, beef stew and a cooked spicy tomato ranchero sauce for beef/cheese enchiladas
we followed their instruction exactly and the bread turned out better than any sour dough that we can purchase from a store, really nice and chewy, and is incredible when toasted
tasty livers ready to eat on crackers, pizza or in a salad
for people who are looking for a crust that taste like real pizza it delicious
it's salty, but delicious and very satisfying and the 3 can box is about the price of a delivery pizza
*****oh, i love this pasta! it is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! and made with authentic flavorings to boot! the red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder
this egg pasta ingredient was "powdered egg product" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing
yesterday, i took the plunge and omgz is this oil awesome!!  i put it to use in my pasta sauce, replacing the olive oil, and it was delicious!  the can says to refrigerate immediately after opening to preserve the oil, but i do not think its going to last very long before its empty
(i still appreciate the novelty!)either way, it is aggressively priced, nice and hot, and unlike the other two sauces i've mentioned, has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being 'spicy oil'
it's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price
it's definitely not like kraft nor road's end, but there's something distinctly cheese-like about it and i found it to be delicious!  i added both peas and broccoli and was pleasantly suprised to find that the cheese sauce was plentiful enough for all of the pasta, peas, and broc
after trying some pastas from my local market, i had given up on finding a tasty alternative
the only thing is - it get softer faster than regular pasta so you shouldn't let it sit, or you shouldn't plan on saving some to eat the next day
very delicious and hit the spot for my pasta craving! i will definitely purchase again!
the beans and pasta do soften up fine, if you follow the directions
the beans will not soften up nor will the pasta
i've been a newman's fan ever since i've got hooked their tasty pasta sauce (i love sockarooni the most)
this orzo is absolutely delicious, with a firm bite and an astounding 9 g of fiber in every serving (and when it comes to pasta, that's what you should be looking for on the package)
this is the healthiest and most delicious choice i've found in whole grain pastas, bar none
while most whole grain pastas are hard and grainy, this has a smooth texture and is very tasty
this orzo is a delicious and healthy pasta!
this whole wheat pasta has delicious taste
this sam mills pasta d'oro is very tasty and i don't think the average person would know it was gluten-free if you didn't tell them
in an era where companies are increasingly using every trick in the books to cut costs of their products, zatarain's black beans and rice surprised me by being an incredibly tasty dish with all rice that could still be microwaved pretty easily
whole wheat pasta shells with white cheddar cheese is delicious!
usually i buy spicy shake n' bake seasonings, so i was prepared to be a little disappointed when i tried my sample of the original pork breading
it turned out to be pretty tasty - the crispy breading added a subtle flavor to the pork and didn't overpower it
and it's delicious--toothy when cooked al dente but with an egg noodle texture that works in all sorts of pastas
it is very hard to find decent tasting pasta / noodles for a low carb lifestyle and these are delicious! taste like egg noodles to me!
first we tried tinkyada rice pasta and we could eat it but it was mushy and soft
but, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again
make a boring white pasta and turn it into a delicious dinner simply by adding the paste
i have put the day old pasta in boiling water for a minute to soften it up and it works, only problem is that it makes the pasta fall apart easier
the pasta is soft and gooey
it will be delicious on vegetables, pasta, seafood, potatoes, etc
i was a little skeptical that i would like these as well as regular pasta, however, i recently made my usual spaghetti sauce and used these miracle noodles and it was as tasty and satisfying as regular noodles
chewy fishy pasta
who wouldn't want to have "pasta" while not actually having pasta? but, all the negative reviews freaked me out, so i was nervous to try them :)  however, i did follow many reviewers' advice and they were delicious
a chewy/gummy noodle, that can be used as a pasta substitute
color me crazy, but i'd rather have half a cup of real, delicious, high-carb pasta than a gallon of miracle noodles
the noodles basically taste like water shaped into pasta, which is fine by me because pasta is more of a vehicle for delicious sauce (in my mind)
just as tasty as what you would find in the grocery store--at a fraction of the price!
(i still appreciate the novelty!)either way, it is aggressively priced, nice and hot, and unlike the other two sauces i've mentioned, has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being 'spicy oil'
have you ever try bbq chicken wings?use this glase and it would be delicious
now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky
as another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn
but it is pretty clear to me that it is tamped down a bit, and not as spicy as the actual "medium" wings that you would get if you ate at the anchor bar itself
still and all, this is a tasty sauce for chicken wings and i would be happy to recommend it for others
it's delicious not only on pancakes, but in teas and just about anything that requires a sweetner! my wife bake some chicken wings yesterday and she coated the wings with the agave nectar, uuummmmm! wish i could give you guys a bite, but sorry, all gone! i highly recommend this product! i keep 4 of the 46 ounce light jars on hand at all times!
just as some people like spicy hot wings, some of us prefer it when we can feel the ginger
sriracha spicy buffalo wings6 chicken wingsoil for frying3 tablespoons frank's red hot sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter, softenedbaby mache or other lettuce to garnishfry the chicken wings until crispy
however, the chicken wings fall apart easily and are very soft the bones literally turn to mush
what's not to love?  whole wings (not thrilled about the bones but they are soft enough to break with your fingers
due to doctors orders, i drink everything decaf - t have found twings to be the best in flavour and aroma
so i rather like the cheekiness of referring to buffalo wings in this product!and these are tasty indeed
tip: i make spicy chicken wings with this sauce and they turn out delicious every time, so easy to make too:preheat oven to 400
the taco bell chipotle sauce is very bold and flavorful! i tried it with chicken wings, tacos, and a salad, and it made each dish extremely tasty
the quality of the noodles was fantastic (a far cry from any of the brands you can buy at the supermarket) but that broth! spicy didn't even begin to describe it
i regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and i put extra hot sauce in spicy chili
if you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup
go to their website for some delicious recipes, my two favs are "shizzled shrimp and grits" and the wife and i love shizzled grilled chicken over pineapple coconut rice
by using williams spicy wings i am known for "my wings"
com/gp/product/b0005zirsm">williams spicy wings seasoned coating mix - 6 packages of 5oz each</a>
i highly recommend this sauce to anyone that likes spicy wings
the unique taste is delicious!  i prefer this mild mix and eat cheese with the hot wings
i slowed down and ate all the wings and boy it was so tasty
sierra nevada fits perfectly between quality and price, delicious and crisp, without being ridiculously overpriced
so if you need a fantastic "go to" sauce this is the one (also fantastic mixed up in some mayo for a spicy mayo spread)
sriracha spicy buffalo wings6 chicken wingsoil for frying3 tablespoons frank's red hot sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter, softenedbaby mache or other lettuce to garnishfry the chicken wings until crispy
but what they mean by spicy is the toned-down peppered-ketchup buffalo wings at applebee's, or maybe even that "bold and spicy" steak sauce they had a tiny taste of once, the one with the cracked pepper in it
maybe spicy v8 or along with a plate of really hot buffalo wings
i'm not a huge fan of anything spicy, but eaten with ranch dressing the buffalo wings pretzel crisps were soooooooo good
i can now dispense it liberally on whatever grub i so choose, and the fact that this stuff is now practically "on tap" in my kitchen means that i'm now trying it out in some recipes - i tossed some chicken wings in this, let them soak in it for a while, then stirred in some melted butter, plucked the wings out and put them under the broiler - delicious
i love spicy food so not a problem for me but my buddies that usually stop at medium wings ended up enjoying a few ore beers than normal eating the thighs i used this jerk on
this product is the bomb!  i have used tamarind in the shell before to make my tamarind wings and it was good but did not have the zing that was needed for the taste i was looking for so i took a chance on ordering wet tamarind, those wings were extremely tasty and had the zing i was looking for thanks to thailand wet tamarind! will definitely use this product again currently ordering three more packs
if you like your wings spicy, but not bar-challenge-sign-a-waiver hot, this sauce should suit you well
multiple brewings, a little going a long way, a great price, and very tasty tea add up to one heck of a package
there was just enough heat (provided by cayenne peppers) to really add life to really tasty set of wings
great for tire swings! and what a harvest! i found them on amazon, and ordered them, and really love them! fresh, tasty, and a lot less work!
the spicy buffalo flavored variety tastes very close to actual frank's hot sauce which was the main ingredient in the original buffalo wings recipe
"they were spicy, but not truly hot, with the right blend of heat and tanginess that good buffalo wings have, and a little lingering ranch flavor at the end
sriracha spicy buffalo wings6 chicken wingsoil for frying3 tablespoons frank's red hot sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter, softenedbaby mache or other lettuce to garnishfry the chicken wings until crispy
delicious seasoning to use on wings and seafood, cant get in stores in ct
this has not happened to me since i ate some really greasy spicy chicken wings for lunch at work in 1993
sriracha spicy buffalo wings6 chicken wingsoil for frying3 tablespoons frank's red hot sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter, softenedbaby mache or other lettuce to garnishfry the chicken wings until crispy
some of my favorite recipes;mix a can of tuna with 1oz of sriracha in a bowl and serve on a sandwich, over rice, or as the core of a spicy tuna maki roll
i did finish the chili but my eyes were watering and there was a spicy aftertaste of something new
wings made with this seasoning are perfect; so delicious! a few prep
this marinade is one of the best i've tried for chicken drumsticks and wings, they come out delicious, a little spicy with a great grill flavor
40min for bone-in chicken and 20min w/o bones is all you need, and it comes out delicious!price is great too
it's kinda nice, actually, having an entire plate of hot wings that are both truly hot and delicious, and safe from even my idiot dogs! i have a feeling this bottle is going to last about a year, then i'll get another
dave's total insanity has a great taste, and is perfect for the spicy food lover in your life, but don't go slathering it on your pile of chicken wings until you have a small taste first
this water is delicious
i will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually diet pepsi or diet coke
my experience with soft drinks has been mostly limited to the major brands so this was quite a change---these sodas have a much cleaner( less chemical)and therefore more refreshing taste than the coke/7up/canada dry variety
you could buy a bottle of juicy juice (or any of the 100% juice options from store brands at most retailers), mix it with a little club soda, and have basically the same product for 1/4 of the price
while i never recommend replacing water with juice, i do get tired of drinking nothing but water, and the switch black cherry is a delicious change that combines juice and carbonation
however, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water
it's not the same as a coke, but it's something tasty and fizzy that i can drink liters of a day
it is a healthful drink and this factor alone makes it ideal for people who search for alternatives to those ghastly flavored, carbonated sugar water soft drinks like coke or pepsi, etc, or other type of fruit drinks loaded with high fructose corn syrup which create false hunger and are so toxic to the liver
the adventurous and those looking for new soft-drink experiences will find it very different from coke, while it remains a cola of sorts
they come in seven delicious flavors, carbonated and non-carbonated, and also in powder stick packets that can be mixed with water
if you're a fan of sonic drive-in and their vanilla coke, torani's sugar-free syrup will replicate that flavor exactly - delicious and you can adjust the flavor to your taste
kind of like a softened soft drink of coke
i love soft drinks, but because i'm pregnant (and because i'm trying to cut down on the amount of sugar i consume overall), i've been trying to limit my coke addiction
libby's "juicy juice 100% grape juice, 46 fl oz" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that coke and pepsi have carved out for themselves
this is a very tasty, not too sugary mix of juices (including white grape and apple), with greapefruit juice (no pulp) and carbonated water addes in
people who are familiar with coffee should know that when you cook fresh bean, you expect to create tasty coffee cream and bubbles (sometimes you'll have a lot, just like coke)
this product is certainly is well-packed!when mixed with cold water, this syrup really is very, very tasty
its super tasty too! im not a health food freak, im addicted to diet cokes and i bought these to replace my daily diet coke in an effort to detox myself of all that fake sugar
diet coke is delicious, and i drink it pretty much all day
however, the downside to this is simple, it encourages children to pick a soft drink over milk, juice, gatorade or water
there are two soft drink giants in north america, and i assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the coca cola company and the pepsi-cola company
the original coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink
both coca cola and diet coke are very refreshing soft drinks with good carbonation that quench your thirst no matter what! now the classic diet coke beverage comes in "fridge packs;" these thin cardboard containers have a dozen 12 ounce cans of diet coke in them
crown royal & coke is cheaper than that for a tasty adult beverage
however, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water
their fanta line of fruit-flavored soft drinks comes closest to this in nutritional values: around 120 calories and 30-35g carbs per 8 oz
the "switch" flavors, however, are tasty enough, but the sugar is about the same as a serving of coke
coca cola is a very refreshing soft drink with good carbonation that quenches your thirst no matter what! now this classic beverage comes in "fridge packs;" these thin cardboard containers have a dozen 12 ounce cans of diet coke in them
it is sharp and spicy and abit hard for me, a lightweight, to take straight, but on ice watered down, which is how i like itit's really excellent and sophisticated tasting
nor am i a really big soft-drink fan, but if it's a choice between sprite or switch?  the cost is similar
it's less sweet than 7-up or sprite and more spicy or peppery with a mild, light vegetable undertone to it from the celery seed extract
while it's less sweet than most soft drinks on the market it's certainly sweet, as corn syrup is the second listed ingredient after carbonated water
it's flavor can be likened to a very softened down version of a sprite or a mountain dew in terms of flavor, carbonation, acidity, and sweetness
sprite is a very refreshing soft drink with good carbonation that quenches your thirst no matter what! this six pack of sprite is good for when you're on the go--it's easy to carry in a cooler during the summer, for example
davinci's sugar free strawberry syrup + sprite zero = diet strawberry soda! it is delicious!
i love all kinds of citrus soft drinks, from diet mountain dew to lemonade to mixing oj with diet sprite
neither my wife nor i are really big soft-drink fans, but if it's a choice between sprite or switch? the cost is similar, and this is definitely the lesser evil
this stuff is pretty tasty- i was thinking it would be more like squirt, but turns out a little more like sprite or 7-up
sprite is my favorite soft drink
sprite is a very refreshing soft drink with good carbonation that quenches your thirst no matter what! now this awesome beverage comes in "fridge packs;" these thin cardboard containers have a dozen 12 ounce cans of sprite in them
sprite has always been one of my favorite soft drinks
you can add more sugur or fake-sugar as you see fit and adust the lemon-lime taste with real fruit or your favorite soft drink such as "diet sprite"
the only term i can think of that describes the new version of knudsen's mandarin lime spritzer is "whooptie-doo!"just for archival purposes, since knudsen's think they're doing us all a favor by ruining this drink, here's a list of differences between the old tasty drink and the new flat 7-up version:old mandarin lime spritzer ingredients:* sparkling filtered water* 70% white grape juice concentrate* natural flavors* tangerine oil* 12oz cannew mandarin lime spritzer ingredients:* sparkling filtered water* 60% white grape, lime and mandarin juice concentrates* natural flavors* 10
it tastes especially well in carbonated soft drinks like sprite zero
all the usual ones, such as 7 up, sprite, mountain dew, and the million other generic-type citrus based soft drinks can't even compare
wow, was it delicious! the syrup gave it a very ginger bread cookie flavor; it even had a bit of bite to it
if you were to compare it to the calorie count per ounce with a soft drink like sprite, it has a little less
this saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy
oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum
long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as i never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides
just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience
i mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food
he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever
every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!
we've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; i'm sure that will be delicious as well
this fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky
coconut water is delicious and refreshing
coconut water w/splash of pineapple & it's delicious & not the least bit sweet
the one coconut water is refreshing, delicious, and just barely sweet
if you want a natural, tasty alternative to water, this is for you
coconut water with a splash of pineapple with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink
bottom line?  it's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability
things i like about this:* perfect size for an hour long gym routine* resealable cap(smaller one lacks this)* tasty (like a pina colada)negative* box makes it hard to get the last drops- usually end up squishing it up to get the last bitso great coconut water, perfect size, and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the amazon's 'subscribe and save'!
if you haven't had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this! simply delicious and so healthy for you!
they are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink (like you don't want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing)
living in az, i tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too!  try them! you'll be hooked :)
in contrast, entenmann's original recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste
when made with just water and a small amount of butter, the crust comes out very, very chewy in my breadmachine
this water is delicious
after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long, this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate
panda all natural soft licorice is a great snack for family movie time
skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil
the chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious
but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water
sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but it's usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice
i buy syrups to make soda with plain seltzer water, and this one is by far the absolute most delicious one i have found
the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth
it's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty
ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic! i can't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat! i would order them again they are that delicious! looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers
the soda is tasty and quite fizzy, i think it has more carbonation than fanta which goes flat easier
dave's nuts are fantastic - hot, spicy
the wolfgang puck coffee, chef's reseerve columbian decaf is fantastic and very delicious
unbelievable good taste - these anchovies are from outer space!!!! they are out of this world!!!!! tasty and delectable, with any meal - you cant go wrong with these - they are a fantastic gourmet item from the sea!  anchovies in general are great, but these far exceed anything i have tasted!
this veggie jerky is fantastic!  the hot & spicy is my favorite, but all are pretty good too
just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable
even if he didn't have epilepsy, i'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way
com/gp/product/b001sb8j0s">loose lip larrys, sauce bbq honey mustard, 16-ounce (6 pack)</a>fantastic slightly spicy bbq sauce
this stuff is fantastic!!!i, too, am not a fan of spicy, but when you serve it on cream cheese, it keeps it calm for the palate
they are both fantastic, and the texas bbq has a nice spicy kick! i think you'll really enjoy this product
pocket coffee's are delicious!  just make sure you put the whole thing in your mouth before biting down!  the center squirts into your mouth and you get to enjoy both the espresso center and chocolate in one fantastic bite!  they make a great gift for non-coffee drinkers too!  i don't drink coffee, but love pocket coffee's!
although freshly and locally made is always better, this tasty bite dish is a fantastic tribute to the cuisine of rajastan and a great choice for everyone to enjoy the wonders of this wonderful indian cuisine at home
more than we expected the flavor is great just the right amount of spicy and heat together and a fantastic price too! very easy to open
this is a fantastic product with delicious flavors of hazelnut dispersed through out the cup
delicious popcorn that is easy to make! what else can i say? get this and all your wildest popcorn eating fantasies will come true!**not a guarantee
the bagels, while a little labor intensive with the boiling, were tender and delicious (and made fantastic roasted red pepper and herbed cream cheese sandwiches)
the taste and texture is just ok so i still haven't found a delicious gluten free bread mix that i can say i love
the flavor is fantastic and the texture is perfect!the vanilla flavour is not overpowering but it's there to help enhance the flavor
i didn't want something boring and flavorless---i was shocked when their regular oat granola was fantastic! each flavor is delicious in its own way!
this is a delicious product, and in my opinion, the best nestle coffee ever!  the price on amazon is fantastic! the butterfinger flavor from nestle is manufactured to be used primarily in coin operated vending machines; however, it is also perfect for in-home instant use
these are fantastic!  keep them cold and grab one to go!  it perfect treat for your morning commute and no stopping at busy chain store and so much cheaper!!  they are delicious and have less calories than you would expect
it is a little spicy--in a good way!  the seasoning really makes great albondigas and fantastic tacos
these were fantastically delicious
there are two soft drink giants in north america, and i assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the coca cola company and the pepsi-cola company
still the same pepsi flavor, just smoother! love it and i think all soft drinks should be made with real sugar again!
i can say that i've noticed my skin getting silkier & a bit softer, which is enough for me to keep drinking it! (well, i'd keep drinking it for the taste as well!)now for price
i put one tablespoon of the tart cherry juice (red or black) in a glass with a can of pepsi (diet no caffine) cola or an old fashioned coca cola, again no sugar a- diet - and it is absolutely delicious
21 dollars is worth the price of 6 pepsi bottles, though you can probably by that much at a store for a smaller cost, but it is still a worthy price for such an amazing and tasty drink!
if youve never tried pepsi, dont, youll just get addicted and its not good to get addicted to soft drinks
it seems like the concentration of the liquid is less and when you want to shake it, it is like you are shaking a bottle of pepsi!!! therefore it's quite natural that it is not as spicy as it is supposed to be
in fact, i never drink soda pop ever, and it's so delicious and movie theater like that i have to make my husband go grab me a big pepsi from the gas station just so i can eat it
the chicken is amazingly soft for frozen biriyani
got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors
if you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  they're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc

20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices
very tasty and very reasonably priced
it was a bit sweeter than i prefer my salsa and given the price i don't think it is something i would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it!
if you like soft licorice, these cats aren't for you
a perfect anise-y balance of salty and sweet, these little licorice kitties are perfect! you pop one (or several) in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journey
i was looking for something not american-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones
anyway, i prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when i get an order ($56 for 2lbs) i leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off
the cocoa is less "tasty" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price
for the times when you'd like to treat yourself, candy tree organic licorice is a tasty and safe treat for gluten intolerant people
it is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic asian supermarket, i guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and i'm not talking about cup o' noodles or things you find at american supermarkets
and i can't get over how delicious each variety is!! the price here is awesome too!
tasty, low fat- just what i needed as a healthy alternative for a great price
these rice crackers are truly delicious w/cheese or peanut butter
it's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty

he loved  bread said it was delicious !!

i use gf corn meal and this mix to make a delicious bread
these shortbread cookies are delicious
i highly recommend these very tasty kavli thin crispbreads
i have been buying this delicious crispbread for many years, but for some reason it is no longer available in stores
with a thin coat of "you won't believe it's not butter" and thin slices of banana, i have a desert or tasty snack; without the banana, i can just eat them as bread, and they are so light and thin with the spread; they are so tasty, and i don't feel guilty after eating them
i think this crispbread is really delicious - a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds
delicious! i will have to try some of the other doctor kracker crispbreads
this flatbread is just delicious
this lingonberries jam has berries in it and looks beautiful as you spread the preserves on pancakes and soft bread
it's truly delicious, easy to make in my bread machine and there are a lot of different flavors
i have used it, (with salt-free tuna and/orsalmon), instead of mayonaise, and added bread crumbs, for adelicious tuna spread!so -- enjoy this condensed soup!  just be aware of the absolutelyt-r-e-m-e-n-d-o-u-s amount of dangerous sodium in it, and drink,eat, and cook with it, accordingly
my daughter and i both loved this bread!  this was our first time trying it and i was a little hesitant but we both thought that it was delicious!
i'm just a droolin' fool thinkin' about these tasty cakes! for all day long it's cakes, cakes, cakes!"japanese bread crumbs they use", says master yoda
the chocolate sandwich part takes a big longer to get soft than the ice cream itself does, so you're likely to end up with a piece of the chocolate breading in your mouth with no ice cream
they remind me of a light,  softer shortbread-type texture
these fabulous little red pearls are even better than craisins!  plump, juicy and perfect in banana bread
this is great to put into a protein shake or smoothie without adding 200 calories and i just had some on my lightened up french toast (low cal bread, egg whites & sugar free syrup) and it was delicious!
spread on saltines, it's delicious, i like it with toast in the morning on oat bread with my cappuccino
it is tasty enough to use as a spread on bread or crackers
i also wanted to leave the recipe that's on the box here for those that want to try out their recipe which i've heard (but haven't verified) is awesome for liege belgian waffles:ingredients:3 1/2 cups bread flour1 packet dry yeast3/4 cup lukewarm milk (~105 f)8 oz softened butter (2 sticks)2 eggs1/2 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon vanillacinnamon (optional)1 bag lars' own belgian pearl sugardirections:dissolve yeast in lukewarm milk
the product itself is delicious and i love this shortbread combination
with minimal mess, trouble and time, you get healthier-than-fried breaded chops that are juicy and taste good
usually i buy spicy shake n' bake seasonings, so i was prepared to be a little disappointed when i tried my sample of the original pork breading
it turned out to be pretty tasty - the crispy breading added a subtle flavor to the pork and didn't overpower it
the pork comes out nicely cooked and the breading is tasty
we made the biscuits per the box recipe and they were tasty and eased my bread craving
these breadcrumbs are delicious
it's sweet, yet spicy (think gingerbread), and reminds me of my travels in the middle east
with regular bread microwaving makes them rubbery but with these it softens them just right
the rolls i made came out surprisingly bread like, chewy in the middle, crispy outside
i think they taste better once cool (less eggy smell) but----seriously----a lot more like bread than i ever imagined, and a healthy tasty snack
the bread is a little chewy, which we love, but soft enough for a child to enjoy
really, really tasty gluten- and grain-free bread mix! so easy to make, i love it
they hold up really well; flaky, but soft like regular gluten bread
i love this mix!  i made these as a bread item for our dinner and my husband and daughter, who normally don't like my gluten-free foods, loved them too!  they have a good chewy texture to them
i was expecting bread like the package says, not! its like eating a sticky chewy pancake
lemon curd is so tasty with scones (of course), biscuits, english muffins or any other bread product, according to personal tastes
at last a really delicious bread mix that tastes like real bread
it's the only mix i've found that makes great sandwiches and better yet, you don't need to toast the bread in order to make it delicious!!!  try this mix if you're gluten intolerant or you want a very delicious bread
